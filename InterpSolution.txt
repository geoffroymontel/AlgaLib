Have an individual output from each used ProxySynthDef with the ramp, and
normalize all the ramps values at the entry of the interpolationProxy Bus.

To do so, the ramps must be summed up and normalized. Then, values should be
reassigned to EACH individual ramp. However, does this require to build my own
Ramp UGen that shares the Bus in order to make the correct assumptions?
