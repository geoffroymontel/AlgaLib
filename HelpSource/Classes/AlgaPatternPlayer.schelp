TITLE:: AlgaPatternPlayer
summary:: Player and dispatcher of AlgaPatterns
categories:: Alga
related:: Classes/Alga, Classes/AlgaPattern, Classes/AlgaTemp

DESCRIPTION::
An link::Classes/AlgaPatternPlayer:: is an link::Classes/AlgaPattern:: player and dispatcher. It stores code::key:: / code::value:: pairs that can be retrieved and consumed by link::Classes/AlgaPattern::s in their execution. Furthermore, an link::Classes/AlgaPatternPlayer:: can take care of the triggering itself of its children link::Classes/AlgaPattern::s.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new
ARGUMENT:: def
An link::Classes/Event:: describing the code::key:: / code::value:: pairs to be executed.
ARGUMENT:: server
Specify a link::Classes/Server:: to instantiated the link::Classes/AlgaPattern:: on. This link::Classes/Server:: must have had link::Classes/Alga:: booted on it. It defaults to code::Server.default::.

private:: addAlgaPatternPlayerEventType

INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: play
Start the execution of the link::Classes/AlgaPatternPlayer::.
ARGUMENT:: sched
Just like any other link::Classes/AlgaNode:: method, the current function can be scheduled at specific times in the future, according to the clock that the link::Classes/Alga:: instance booted on the server is using.

METHOD:: advance
Manually advance the link::Classes/AlgaPatternPlayer::.

METHOD:: step
Alias for code::advance::.

METHOD:: stop
Stop the link::Classes/AlgaPatternPlayer::

METHOD:: from
ARGUMENT:: sender
A new value for the parameter.
ARGUMENT:: param
The parameter to modify.
ARGUMENT:: time
The time it will take to perform the changes. Note that this will be transferred to every link::Classes/AlgaPattern::s that are using the link::Classes/AlgaPatternPlayer::.
ARGUMENT:: sched
Just like any other link::Classes/AlgaNode:: method, the current function can be scheduled at specific times in the future, according to the clock that the link::Classes/Alga:: instance booted on the server is using.

METHOD:: <<
Alias for code::from::.

METHOD:: at
ARGUMENT:: param
The parameter to retrieve from the link::Classes/AlgaPatternPlayer::.
ARGUMENT:: repeats
Similarly to link::Classes/Pfuncn::, this represents the number of times to repeat the reading of the parameter.

METHOD:: read
ARGUMENT:: func
A link::Classes/Function:: representing the action to perform when reading a group of parameters from the link::Classes/AlgaPatternPlayer::. The arguments to the function must match the names of parameters in the link::Classes/AlgaPatternPlayer::.
ARGUMENT:: repeats
Similarly to link::Classes/Pfuncn::, this represents the number of times to perform the function.

METHOD:: value
Alias for code::read::.

METHOD:: addAction
Execute a link::Classes/Function:: on the scheduler of this node.
ARGUMENT:: condition
A link::Classes/Function:: that must return code::true:: or code::false::. If not specified, the condition is always considered code::true::.
ARGUMENT:: func
The link::Classes/Function:: to execute.
ARGUMENT:: sched
When should the function be executed. This can also be an link::Classes/AlgaStep::.
ARGUMENT:: topPriority
Specify if the function should be put at the top of the prioroty queue.
ARGUMENT:: preCheck
Specify if the function should be executed right away in the case of a code::true:: condition.

METHOD:: sched
Manually set a code::sched:: value to use when not specified explicitly.

METHOD:: time
Manually set a code::time:: value to use when not specified explicitly.

EXAMPLES::
code::
(
Alga.boot({
	//Define and start an AlgaPatternPlayer
	~player = AlgaPatternPlayer((
		dur: Pwhite(0.1, 0.5),
		freq: Pseq([440, 880], inf)
	)).play;

	//Use ~player for both indexing values and triggering the pattern
	~pattern = AP((
		def: { SinOsc.ar(\freq.kr + \freq2.kr) * EnvPerc.ar },
		freq: ~player[\freq],
		freq2: ~player.read({ | freq |
			if(freq == 440, { freq * 2 }, { 0 })
		}),
	), player: ~player).play(chans: 2);
})
)

//Interpolation still works
~pattern.from(~player.({ | freq | freq * 0.5 }), \freq, time: 5) //.value == .read
~pattern.from(~player.({ | freq | freq * 2 }), \freq2, time: 5)

//Modify dur
~player.from(0.5, \dur, sched: AlgaStep(3))

//If modifying player, the interpolation is still triggered on the children
~player.from(Pseq([330, 660], inf), \freq, time: 5)

//Removing a player stops the pattern triggering
~pattern.removePlayer;
